# DESIGNING_A_DAYTIME-_SECURITY_CAMERA_LENS
Modern security cameras can be quite complex, operating in both the visible and near-infrared wavelength bands with very large fields of view (FOVs) and mounted on a motorized stage to scan and zoom the scene. I focused on a much simpler security camera, whose purpose is to record objects and activity within a moderately sized (fixed) field and provide surveillance in the visible band only. In most instances, such cameras are mounted overhead or on ceilings.
 I designed a camera with a smaller, 50Â° full FOV (this means that the person would need to be more than 6' from the camera to capture their full height). After entering this value and the 6-mm CMOS sensor diagonal into equation ,the EFL for our lens is 6.43 mm.
